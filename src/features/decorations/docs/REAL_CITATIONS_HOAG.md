## Key Patterns Observed

### Rank Progression in Language

| Rank | Opening Verb | Narrative Style |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| SrA | "dedication to mission and technical skill enabled" | Task-focused, quantified outputs |
| SSgt | "outstanding professional skill, knowledge, and leadership aided immeasurably" | More leadership language |
| TSgt | "attention to detail and strategic understanding" | Strategic context added |
| MSgt | "was selected as" (passive - implies recognition) | Enterprise-level impact |

### Quantification by Rank

- **SrA:** Equipment counts, dollar values, percentages
- **SSgt:** Same + team size, project scope
- **TSgt:** Same + mission impact (targets, analysts supported)
- **MSgt:** Same + enterprise metrics ($270M acquisition, wing-level)

### Structure Patterns

1. **Opening** → Position and org
2. **Selection/Recognition** → "was selected," "handpicked" (for special roles)
3. **Core Duties** → Quantified daily responsibilities  
4. **Innovation** → "first-ever," "developed," "authored"
5. **Mission Impact** → Combat operations, command support
6. **Recognition** → Awards won, designations earned
7. **Closing** → Standard template

### Character Count Reality

Most of these citations exceed the 1350 character MyDecs limit:
- Shortest: 869 (AFAM)
- Longest: 1,489 (AFCM)
- Average: ~1,300

**Note:** These were all written **pre-MyDecs Reimagined** (Oct 2022). The 1350 character limit is now enforced. New citations must be more concise than these examples.

**Implication for prompts:** When generating, we need to condense similar content into ~1350 chars — about 10-15% shorter than these historical examples.
